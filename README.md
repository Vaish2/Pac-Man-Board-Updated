			Assigment submission by Vaishanvi Ganesan

The pacman class and the helper functions for the assignment is written down
in the 'pacman.py' module. 
The 'main.py' file runs only the 'test.txt' file. Any custom 'test.txt' file can be provided to this main file.
The 'main_multiple.py' file takes " 'test1.txt', 'test2.txt' ... 'test10.txt' " and 
outputs it all onto the terminal.
